# Diagram Buffer Service
This plugin takes diagram information a project in Geodesignhub using the [Geodesign Hub](https://www.geodesignhub.com/). It then provides a way to buffer them and then upload the buffer to a different or same system as a new diagram available to be used in a design. This is especially useful when you are designing protection zones, conservation areas etc. 

### Adding the plugin
This plugin can be added to your project in the Administration panel

## Screenshots
Set the buffer distance and compute the buffer, then set details to add the computed buffer as a new diagram.
